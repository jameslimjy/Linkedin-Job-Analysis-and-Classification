We consider product customer and tech platforms as constraints and use all the levers at our disposal (price campaign search sorting and processes around them) to get the best possible outcome (read Sales and Profit). It is a standalone department from commercial and marketing.<br/><br/>Revenue Analytics is one of the 4 building blocks of the Revenue Office together with Merchandising Pricing and PMO. As the data analytics brain the team is responsible for establishing the analytical structure within the function and ensuring that every team’s work is fully consistent with the overall growth objectives of the company. This includes tools and process creation around how data will be used in the team as well as application of advanced analytics and data science in business scenarios to unlock new opportunities and take the current state to the next level.<br/><br/>As we are expanding the scope of the team which ultimately looks at conversion rate (CR) we recently set up a growth hacking squad. The goal is to have the squad continuously experimenting with various proof-of-concepts at a fast rhythm independent of the regular tech development cycle. The team will be expanded to enable more focus on growth hacking initiatives starting with one person (this role) fully dedicated to CR optimisation.<br/><br/>At Zalora we operate in a fast-paced environment so it won’t be a stroll in the park and there will be plenty of challenging work in parallel. Reporting to the Revenue Analytics manager you can expect to be stretched to deliver quality work with relatively short turnaround time take ownership of your deliverable and also an abundance of learning.

We think there is value in early intervention. Using mass-spectrometry-based proteomic data the first goal is to therefore examine at what point resolution of batch effects provides greatest positive impact (raw data peptide identification inferred protein). Secondly ambiguously mapped peptides are often discarded prior to protein mapping but also carry useful information regarding batch-effect loading this project examines the cost in terms of being able to estimate batch effect of discarding this information source. Thirdly missing values are common in proteomics data and are usually resolved by imputation prior to batch effect correction imputation approaches usually ignore the batch covariate such that batch effects can creep into proteins due to careless imputation.<br/><br/>Your primary role is in would be to help examine the extent of this problem.
