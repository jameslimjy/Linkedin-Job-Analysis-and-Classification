# Linkedin-Job-Analysis-and-Classification

This is a personal project that incorporates the following elements:
- Web scraping
- Data cleaning
- NLP Preprocessing
- EDA
- Classification
    - Naive Bayes classifier
    - Logistic Regression classifier
    - Keras (LSTM) classifier

There are 2 main files, EDA.ipynb and ML-Classification.ipynb. **EDA.ipynb** contains some data analysis I did with the data that I scraped from Linkedin whereas **ML-Classfication.ipynb** contains three classification models that I built. These classification models predict job titles given job descriptions. The web scraper that I built to scrape the data from Linkedin can be found in **Scraper.ipynb**.
